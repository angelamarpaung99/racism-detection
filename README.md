<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is Racism Detection System that was built to detect racism on Indonesian tweets text. 
This project uses Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) using Python programming language. 

### Dataset
Dataset is collected from Twitter.
Dataset contains three columns of data: number, tweets, label. 
Data collected is 686 tweets, in which each of the tweets is labelled manually. 
Labelled tweets resulted in 511 tweets for class Non_R (Non Racism)  and 175 tweets for class R (Racism). 
Since this dataset is imbalanced, you can do under-sampling to create balanced dataset.

### Built With
